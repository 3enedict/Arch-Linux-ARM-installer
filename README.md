This is an Arch Linux ARM installer script that works pretty well, especially if you have to install arch arm a lot. This script can also be used as a base for new users who don't really know how arch linux arm works (for the raspberry pi version anyway).

I am going to try to put a wiki to explain what this script does, but in the meantime, post an issue if you have a question or a problem.

PS : This was tested with a raspberry pi 3 model B so it might not work with other versions of the raspbery pi.
