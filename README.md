This is an Arch Linux ARM installer script that works wonders, especially if you have to install arch arm a lot. This script can also be used as a base for new users who don't really know how arch linux arm works (for the raspberry pi version anyway).

PS : This was tested with a raspberry pi 3 model B so it might not work with other versions of the raspbery pi.
